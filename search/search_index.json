This will open the web console on your browser. You should see a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform window with Username and Password forms as shown below: Username: developer Password: developer After logging in to the web console, you'll be on a Projects page. What is a project? Why does it matter? OpenShift is often referred to as a container application platform in that it is a platform designed for the development and deployment of applications in containers. To group your application, we use projects. The reason for having a project to contain your application is to allow for controlled access and quotas for developers or teams. More technically, it's a visualization of the Kubernetes namespace based on the developer access controls. Exercise: Creating a Project Click the blue Create Project button. You should now see a page for creating your first project in the web console. Fill in the Name field as myproject . The rest of the form is optional and up to you to fill in or ignore. Click Create to continue. After your project is created, you will see some basic information about your project. Exercise: Explore the Administrator and Developer Perspectives Notice the navigation menu on the left. When you first log in, you'll typically be in the Administrator Perspective . If you are not in the Administrator Perspective , click the perspective toggle and switch from Developer to Administrator . You're now in the Administrator Perspective , where you'll find Operators , Workloads , Networking , Storage , Builds , and Administration menus in the navigation. Take a quick look around these, clicking on a few of the menus to see more options. Now, toggle to the Developer Perspective . We will spend most of our time in this tutorial in the Developer Perspective . The first thing you'll see is the Topology view. Right now it is empty, and lists several different ways to add content to your project. Once you have an application deployed, it will be visualized here in Topology view.","title":"Lab1"},{"location":"lab1/#lab-1-connect-to-openshift-and-create-your-first-application-using-the-web-interface","text":"In this lab, we will connect to OpenShift and create an application from the Web Interface","title":"Lab 1 : Connect to Openshift and create your first application using the Web interface"},{"location":"lab1/#exercise-logging-in-with-the-web-console","text":"To begin, click on the Console tab on your screen.
